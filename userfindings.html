                <h4>User Interviews</h4>
                <p>A user interview is an important aspect of user research that allows the developer or product idealist to undestand their userbase. Some of the questions asked in my interviews pertained to getting to know the user at a professional level and getting input as to what features of my portfolio would be the most useful to them.</p>

                <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
                <p>A competitor analysis allows everyone on the team to know what kinds of website or products could directly (or indirectly) be competing against your product. Through this, I was able to analyze how websites like LinkedIn or Handshake could be direct competitors with my portfolio.</p>

                <h4>Feature Value Matrix</h4>
                <p>A feature value matrix is a chart that allows a team of developers and product managers to rate what features would have the best user value, business value, and the most minimal development effort.</p>

                <br>

                <h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
                <p>After gathering results from the user interviews that I conducted and then putting them in the feature value matrix, I then was able to plot the results on a feature prioritization graph based on the ratings given for development effort and business/user value. </p>

                <h4>User Stories</h4>
                <p>User Stories are important because they allow me as a developer to understand some of the main goals of the features that I'm putting on my portfolio. This allowed me to assess some of the features that I had on my website even more. If I had an end goal to each component of the page, then I start to prioritize the features that I think would best benefit many users.</p>

                <br>

                <h4>Cognitive Walkthrough</h4>
                <p>A cognitive walkthrough allows the developer to meet in person with a tester (preferably people that could potentially be using the product) and have the user perform tests under the developer's directions. Users would conduct tasks, and based off of the results of those tasks, both parties can identify problems and generate possible solutions to those problems. It was difficult for me to remain completely neutral during the walkthrough since I wanted the user to fully understand how to navigate my site after they tried, but I learned through the process that it's not usually going to be perceived the "right" way immediately.</p>

                <h4>User Test</h4>
                <p>On Usability Hub, I decided to do a five-second test and a click test. I did the click test mainly to test out the usability and clarity of my navigation bar. I did a five-second test because I was worried that I might have put too much text on the page. I thought that the best way to do that was through having people be able to repeat information from my About Me from five seconds of reading.</p>

                <hr class="heading-bar">

                <p>Pulling everything together, I've gotten a taste of what people would expect or would at least want to see from a portfolio website (based off of what they already know or don't know about portfolios). From conducting user interviews, I was able to see some commonalities in what the people I interviewed would want to see in a portfolio, and this weighed heavily into my feature value matrix. I wasn't exactly sure what ratio of questions about the user to feature preference questions I should have in the interviews. Though it weighed heavliy on getting to know the user, I was able to recieve some valuable infomation that better helped me understand my user base. The competitor analysis helped me see that though there are more established websites out there that would compete against my portfolio, I had the freedom of customizability and control of content, which was very limited in most of the websites that I analyzed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I really benefitted from user testing because it allowed me to see first-hand what kinds of decisions people make when navigating my website and also gave me insight on what changes I should make now and in the future. Through the five-second test, I was able to affirm that I had too much text on the page when noticing that some of my users had trouble recalling different things. There were some users that even completely passed questions because they just couldn't remember anything. This allowed me to see that I needed to be more straight to the point and visual when describing the things on my portfolio. The cognitive walkthroughs were the most helpful becuase I was given some concrete feedback on my website (versus trying to gauge on my own what changes I should make based off of online tests). </p>
