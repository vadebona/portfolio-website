                <hr class="heading-bar">
                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm currently a fourth year computer science major at UCI. I'm originally from South Central Los Angeles, but I tell everyone that I'm from Inglewood because I live a few short blocks from the border.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h4>Technical Interests</h4>
                    <div class="technologies">
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="tech-border">Front-end</span></li>
                            <li><span class="tech-border">Full-Stack</span></li>
                            <li><span class="tech-border">Mobile</span></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                <p>
                         I believe that with front-end development, I can design and develop programs that actually interact with the user and put users' needs first. The design and user interface of a website is what a user sees first when they search up a URL, and I want contributing to that to be the center of my career.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                    <p>
                        Aside from programming, I'm also interested in reading articles about the Internet of Things. <a href="http://thenextweb.com">The Next Web</a> and <a href="http://theverge.com">The Verge</a> are some of my favorite websites to go to for udpates in the industry. During some of my spare time, I like playing music. I play the keyboard, and I recently picked up drums, ukulele, and some guitar.

                        <h4>UCI Athletics IT</h4>
                        <p> 
                            During undergrad, I worked for UCI's Athletics IT Department as a student application developer. I was introduced to Scrum development practices and learned how to develop web applications using the LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and front end web technologies. </p>
                        <p> 
                            I stayed as a full time Web Application Developer after graduation and got more involved in the development life cycle, including requirements planning and demoing new features to Athletics clients.</p>

                        <h4>UCI Academic Web Technologies</h4>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://sites.uci.edu/eee/" target="_blank">Academic Web Technologies</a> (AWT) is the IT team that develops and manages the main UCI learning management system that tens of thousands of faculty, staff and students use. For about a year, I was a developer on the team working in a PHP framework called <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> (not like a musical Symphony). Some of the applcations I contributed to are <a href="https://scout.eee.uci.edu/"> EEE+ Scout</a> and <a href="https://evaluations.eee.uci.edu/"> EEE+ Evaluations</a>.</p>

                        <h4>AppCamp</h4>
                        <p> 
                            In the summer of 2016, I was a mentor for AppCamp. AppCamp is a week-long summer program that UCI holds with the engineering and Information and Computer Sciences schools to teach middle school kids in the OC area about computer science concepts. During this program, I mentored students between 6th and 9th grade as they learned how to use Scratch, Arduino, Scratch4Arduino, and AppInventor to apply what they have learned. These students would ultimately create an AppInventor app in teams by the end of the week and present them to their peers.

                <p>On a team of student developers and a Graduate medical student, I participated in a two-week long UCI medical AppJam. We created an app that improves the communication between patients and their doctors. Patients would put some of the symptoms that they were suffering from (whether they were from medications that they were taking, a disease they were suffering from, etc) on a timeline in the application, and this timeline (by the patient's choice) would be parsed to create a document that would be sent to their doctors so that the doctor has all of that information in one place.</p>
