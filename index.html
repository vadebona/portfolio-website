                <h1>ABOUT ME.</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm currently a fourth year computer science major at UCI. I'm originally from South Central Los Angeles, but I tell everyone that I'm fron Inglewood because I live a few short blocks from the border.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        I have a computer science background (data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, etc.), but my real interests lie in front-end web and mobile development. With other aspects of coding that usually happen behind the scenes, I rarely get to see much of what happens on the outside from the user's perspective. I believe that with front-end development, I can design and develop programs that actually interact with the user and put users' needs first. The design and user interface of a website is what a user sees first when they search up a URL, and I want contributing to that to be the center of my career.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h4>HOBBIES.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Aside from programming, I'm also interested in reading articles about the Internet of Things. <a href="http://thenextweb.com">The Next Web</a> and <a href="http://theverge.com">The Verge</a> are some of my favorite websites to go to for udpates in the industry. During some of my spare time, I like playing music. I play the keyboard, and I recently picked up drums, ukulele, and some guitar.

                        <h4>ATHLETICS IT</h4>
                        <p> I currently work for UCI's Athletics IT Department as a student application developer. I just got the job, so I'm still getting used to how things work there. However, I know that I will be working on some of the web applications that a lot of the athletes and coaches use to manage their team finances and help facilitate the communication between each other. </p>

                        <h4>APPCAMP</h4>
                        <p> In the summer of 2016, I was a mentor for AppCamp. AppCamp is a week-long summer program that UCI holds with the engineering and Information and Computer Sciences schools to teach middle school kids in the OC area about computer science concepts. During this program, I mentored students between 6th and 9th grade as they learned how to use Scratch, Arduino, Scratch4Arduino, and AppInventor to apply what they have learned. These students would ultimately create an AppInventor app in teams by the end of the week and present them to their peers. It was a really rewarding experience, as I was about see the need for more kids to learn about computer science from a young age. I was also glad to participate since I didn't have a summer program like this in middle school.</p>

                <h1>PROJECTS.</h1>

                <br>

                <h4>FLOODBAKO.</h4>
                <p>This is a website that I'm helping my friend's mom design that helps people contribute to a Bakersfield Flood relief fund. The website is mainly built using WordPress, and I'm building upon the current design that is used and making it more modern using some of the tools that WordPress provides as well as some front-end code (if needed).</p>

                <br>

                <h4>FABFLIX.</h4>
                <p> On a team of three, I helped to create a mock movies e-commerce website (I say mock because the movie check out process doesn't actually take any money or connect to a movie provider). This website used a MySQL database to hold all the information about the movies, as well as the account information of website users. Users could log into an account and search for movies by name or genre. We used an online server called Tomcat and Amazon Web Services to get our website online and did most of the front-end using Bootstrap. All sections of the application were connected using Java.</p>

                <br>

                <h4>HEALTH COMBINDER.</h4>
                <p>On a team of student developers and a Graduate medical student, I participated in a two-week long UCI medical AppJam. We created an app that improves the communication between patients and their doctors. Patients would put some of the symptoms that they were suffering from (whether they were from medications that they were taking, a disease they were suffering from, etc) on a timeline in the application, and this timeline (by the patient's choice) would be parsed to create a document that would be sent to their doctors so that the doctor has all of that information in one place. This was an Android application so everything was built natively using Android Studio and Java.</p>

                <h4>WOMEN IN INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES (WICS).</h4>
                <p><a href="http://wics.ics.uci.edu">WICS</a> is a UCI professional/social organization that aims to empower, support and retain women in computer science and related fields. We do a lot of company events (info sessions, networking, etc.) and social events, and we even have our own mentorship and K-12 outreach programs. This club has changed my view of the role of women in computer science and has shown me a lot of what the computing field has to offer.</p>

                <br>

                <p>I served as a marketing committee member when I first joined WICS, and am now the Secretary. As a marketing committee member, I helped market our weekly events through social media, UCI email bulletins, and even physical posters located around campus. As the secretary of WICS, I send out weekly newsletter to all of our members, which account for the majority of our attendance at our events. I also take notes during board meetings and committee meetings, and manage our committee during events as we set up and take down. </p>
